# Arkanoid Python
**An *Arkanoid* vintage game clone made in Python**

## What is Arkanoid?
Arkanoid is a 1986 block breaker arcade game developed and published by Taito. Controlling the paddle, a player is tasked with clearing a formation of colorful blocks by deflecting a ball towards it without letting the ball leave the bottom edge of the playfield.

## Description
I started this project by setting up the ball object which constantly moves in X and Y direction and dependently on which side of the screen it collides with - it changes the direction accordingly to the opposite one. After that I set a paddle which can be moved left or right within the width of the screen. The ball also collide with the paddle and change it's direction after hit. I thought making a parallax effect on the background would be cool so I implemented it as well.
